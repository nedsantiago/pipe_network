# Pipe Network
## Description
Manually building a pipe network based on field reports is both error-prone and tedious. This project aims to directly convert manhole survey reports into a network model.
## General Information
Date Started: 25th January 2024

Objectives:
* Easier conversion of manhole survey data into pipe network.

## TODO List
* replace __new__. The GraphComponent object wont require an initial id, but will check any id passed.
* fill-out the Structures attributes getter, setters, etc.
