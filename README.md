# Pipe Network
## Description
Manually building a pipe network based on field reports is both error-prone and tedious. This project aims to directly convert manhole survey reports into a network model.
## General Information
Date Started: 25th January 2024

Objectives:
* Easier conversion of manhole survey data into pipe network.

## TODO List
* The GraphComponent will check any id passed.
* fill-out the Structures attributes and their getter, setters, etc.
* fill-out the Links attributes and their getter, setters, etc.
* abstract method for a tracker for Dependency Inversion Principle. Create a class that requires the implementation of an add, remove, element_set, and must inherit a __new__ method that creates a singleton class.

## Project Notes
* Attempting to use some SOLID Principles:
Single Responsibility
Interface Segragation
Dependancy Inversion Principle
